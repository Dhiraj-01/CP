### Problem
```
Given an array of size n and k
Return the count of subsequences "subseq" where max(subseq) - min(subseq) <= k
1 <= n <= 1e5
```

### Solution
```
sort array + 2 pointer
for each l = 0 to l = n
    current index l, find max r such that (a[r] - a[l]) <= k
    ans += 2 ^ (r - l)
```

### Bonus
```
how to count all subarray ?
such that max(subarray) - min(subarray) <= k

similar approach because minimum and maximum is monotonic function
so a[l ....... r] is valid subarray then a[l], a[l, l+1], a[l, l+1, l+2], ... a[l, ... , r-1] is valid subarray

for each l = 0 to l = n
    current index l, find max r such that (a[r] - a[l]) <= k
    ans += (r - l)
