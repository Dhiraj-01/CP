### Problem
```
You have a tree of N nodes, and you can do M queries on the tree.
The queries are of two types -
1 a x => add a to node x and all its descendents
2 x => find the sum of values of all nodes in the path b/w the root node and the node x (both root and x inclusive).
```

### Solution
```
Learn tree, flatten tree, segment tree :)
