### Problem
```
You are given a rooted binary tree with weights on edges.
The distance between two nodes in this tree is the sum of the edge weights on
the path between the two nodes. SUM[u] is the sum of the distances between 
u and all the other nodes in the tree.

task1 : Calculate Sum[root]
task2 : Calculate the array SUM for all nodes 1 to N.

Example :
(u v w) edge u to v with weight w
9
1 2 50
1 3 10
2 6 10
2 7 10
7 8 3
7 9 4
3 4 30
3 5 20

Sum[1] = 377
Sum[2] = 327
Sum[6] = 277
....

Expected time complexity = O(N).
N = Number of node in given tree.
