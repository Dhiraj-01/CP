### Problem
```
You are given a binary tree with colored edges, where each edge can be either red or black. 
You can perform only the following operation on the tree: select a node. 
When you select a node, all the edges on the path from the root node to the selected node become red. 
Return the minimum number of operations required to color all the edges red.

Example binary tree:
     3
   /   \
  1     2
/  \   /  \
4  6  7  10

Edge colors:
3 -> 1 (black)
1 -> 4 (red)
1 -> 6 (black)
3 -> 2 (red)
2 -> 7 (black)
2 -> 10 (red)

Answer is 2. 
3 -> 6 and 3 -> 7
```

### Solution
```cpp
// adj[u] = [left child, right child]
ll dfs(ll u)
{
    if(u is leaf) return 0;
    
    ll v1 = adj[u][0]; // left child
    ll v2 = adj[u][1]; // right child

    ll left_ans = dfs(v1);
    ll right_ans = dfs(v2);

    ll ans = left_ans + right_ans;
    if(clr[u][v1] == "black" and left_ans == 0) {
        ans++;
    }
    if(clr[u][v2] == "black" and right_ans == 0) {
        ans++;
    }
    return ans;
}
```
