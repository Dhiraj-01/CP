### Problem
```
There are two people (p1 and p2). They are playing a game, where an array with
some values is given. p1 makes the first turn, and p2 makes the 2nd turn, and
this goes on. p1 play optimally, i.e. it always plays to select those value
from the array which makes his sum maximum. p1 can pick any of the available
value from the array. p2 does not play optimally. p2 simply picks the first
available value (from the left).
print "p1_score p2_score" both player score.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= a[i] <= 1e9
```

**Input (1)**
```
3
1 3 7
```

**Output (1)**
```
10 1
```

**Explanation (1)**
```
a = {1, 3, 7}
p1_score = p2_score = 0
p1 take 3, p1_score = 3, p2_score = 0
a = {1, 7}
p2 take 1 (left most), p1_score = 3, p2_score = 1
a = {7}
p1 take 7, p1_score = 10, p2_score = 1
a = {}

answer: 10 1
```

**Input (2)**
```
3
100 10 200
```

**Output (2)**
```
300 10
```

**Explanation (2)**
```
a = {100, 10, 200}
p1_score = p2_score = 0
p1 take 100, p1_score = 100, p2_score = 0
a = {10, 200}
p2 take 10 (left most), p1_score = 100, p2_score = 10
a = {200}
p1 take 200, p1_score = 300, p2_score = 10
a = {}

answer: 300 10
```

### Tag
`Easy`, `Microsoft`, `Heap (priority queue)`, `Greedy`

### Solution
```
pure greedy doesn't work here (i mean, each time choose max element from here) ..
