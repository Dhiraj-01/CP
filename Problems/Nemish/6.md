### Problem
```
Given linked list head pointer. Length of the LinkedList is unknown.
Given two integers N and M.

print ((N / M) * (length of LinkedList))th node data without calculating length of LinkedList.
(only in single traversal of linked lists).

NOTE: (N <= M) and (length of LinkedList is divisible by M)
so, ((N / M) * (Length of LinkedList)) is always an integer number.

Ex:
N = 3, M = 4
LinkedList is: 1-> 2-> 3-> 4-> 5-> 6-> 7-> 8-> 9-> 10-> 11-> 12
(3 / 4) * 12 = 9th node data = 9

 N = 2, M = 3
LinkedList: 6-> 8-> 9-> 14-> 67-> 5-> 7-> 56-> 56
(2 / 3) * (9) = 6th node data = 5
```
