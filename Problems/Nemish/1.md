### Problem
```
Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

push(item), which adds an element to the stack
pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)
Recall that a heap has the following operations:

push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap
```

### Solution
(1)
```
if item is positive intergers then
in push we will push current max + item to heap and
in pop we find 2nd max and return 1st max - 2nd max
and remove 1st max

ex.
push
5 3 6 2 4 1

heap at every step
5
5 8
5 8 14
5 8 14 16
5 8 14 16 20
5 8 14 16 20 21

It can work for negative as well if you shift all the elements. I mean if range is -x to y then add x as well as top element of heap to the element being pushed.

Basically shifting the numbers on the number line

What I mean is if range is -x to y then add x to each element before pushing (before adding max) and remove x after pop (after removing second highest val)
```

(2)

```
we maintain two heap for positive and negative numbers

in push(x)
if x positive
    pos heap push(abs(x) + maximum in both heap till now)
else 
    neg heap push(abs(x) + maximum in both heap till now)

in pop()
if pos heap.top() >= neg heap top() 
    then top of stack is postive number and 
    top = pos.top() - second max in both heap

else
    top of stack is negative number
    top = neg.top() - second max in both heap
    top = -top
