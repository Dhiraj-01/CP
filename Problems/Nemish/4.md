### Problem
```
Given f6(), return random number between 1 to 6 with equal probability
Design f18().

int f18()
{
    // using f6()
    // which will return random number between 1 to 18 with equal probability
}
```

### Solution
```
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18

6 * 6 matrix
return mat[f6()-1][f6()-1]
```

### Bonus
```
do it without creating matrix (do some maths)
```

### Similar problem
```
Given coin (equal probability of head, tail), implement unbiased coin with 
head probability (1/4) and tail (3/4) probability.

Solution.
[H, T]
[T, T]
Return mat[rand2()][rand2()]
// rand2() return random value between [0, 1] (head or tail)
```
