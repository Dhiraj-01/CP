### Problem
```
You are given an array of strings (size N).
You have to process Q queries of the type â€” "L R k". For each query,
print the kth character of the string formed by merging all the strings from L to R and sorting them.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= Q <= 1e5
1 <= L <= R <= N
There is always a valid kth position
```

**Input**
```
3
abcc trea zape
2
2 3 5
2 2 1
```

**Output**
```
p
a
```

**Explanation**
```
N = 3, strings = ["abcc", "trea", "zape"]
Q = ["2 3 5", "2 2 1"]

For first query, concatenated string is "treazape".
After sorting, it becomes "aaeeprtz". 5th character is 'p'.

For second query, concatenated string is "trea". 
After sorting becomes "aert". 1st character is 'a'.
```

### Solution
```
we can maintain just prefix sums for each character. ex. pre[index][char].
Then for each query, we can just iterate over all characters from 'a' to 'z'
and have total characters till now and when it becomes >= K, we got our answer 
for the query as the current character.

Time complexity: O(Q * 26)
Space complexity: O(N * 26)
