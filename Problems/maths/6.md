### Problem
```
There is an array of length N. Some places are empty (E), some are dirty (D), and some have food on it (F).
You have to group all the food into consecutive cells with the following rules:
— Moving food to adjacent cell costs 'x' amount of coins
— Cleaning a dirty cell costs 'y' coins
— After cleaning, the dirty cell becomes empty
— You can only move food to an adjacent empty cell

Now, you have to process Q queries of the type "x y". In each query, print the minimum cost required to group all foods together.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= N, Q <= 1e5
0 <= x, y <= 1e5
```

**Input**
```
5
FEDEF
1
1 2
```

**Output**
```
5
```

**Explanation**
```
N = 5, Array = "FEDEF"
Q = 1, first query x = 1, y = 2
It is optimal to first clean the dirty cell at position 3, this will cost 2 amount of coins.
After cleaning the array becomes — "FEEEF". Now we can move foods in the following manner — "EFFEE". This will cost 3 * 1 = 3 coins.
So final cost will be 3 + 2 = 5

### Solution
try this https://codeforces.com/contest/1520/problem/E  
```
Find the first and last occurrence of 'F', let them be l and r.
We don't care about anything before l and after r.
Let cnt = total number of F.
Make all the D's in between l and r to E using y coins for each.
Now the problem is same as https://codeforces.com/contest/1520/problem/E
