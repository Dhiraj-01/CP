### Problem
```
Given an array of size n and an integer m. Our task is to find the prefix sum of the array m number of times repeatedly. And print the array after it.

Sample Input
2
3 2
1 2 3
5 3
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output
1 4 10
1 5 15 35 70

Explanation:-
In the second sample, the array goes like
1st time - 1 3 6 10 15
2nd time - 1 4 10 20 35
3rd time - 1 5 15 35 70  which is the output.

constraints
1 <= T <= 20
2 <= N <= 1000
1 <= M <= 1000000000
```
