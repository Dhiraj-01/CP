### Problem
```
Given an array of size n.
find size of max subset such that AND(elements of subset) > 0
AND = both bit set 1 then 1 else 0

Constraints:
n <= 1e5
a[i] <= 1e9

Input:
a = [5, 2, 1]

Output:
2

Explanation:
[5, 1] is valid longest subset
```

### Solution
```
we just want AND > 0
AND > 0 means their is atleast one bit set in all choosen elements of subset
```

```cpp
using ll = long long int;
ll f(vector<ll> a)
{
    ll ans = 0;
    ll n = a.size();
    for(ll bit = 0; bit < 32; bit++)
    {
        ll cur = 0;
        for(ll j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            if(a[j] & (1ll << bit))
            {
                cur++;
            }
        }
        ans = max(ans, cur);
    }
    return ans;
}
```
