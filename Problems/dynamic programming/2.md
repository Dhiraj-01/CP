### Problem
```
given array of n elements and target integer.
We can either add the current element or substract it from result.
can we find any possible combination such that result of that combination is k.

ex. a = [1, 2, 3], target = 6
answer : true

a = [1, 2, 3], target = 2
answer = true

a = [1, 2, 3], target = 1
answer = false

possible combinations,
+1 + 2 + 3 = 6
+1 + 2 - 3 = 0
+1 - 2 + 3 = 2
+1 - 2 - 3 = -4
-1 + 2 + 3 = 4
-1 + 2 - 3 = -2
-1 - 2 + 3 = 0
-1 - 2 - 3 = -6
```
